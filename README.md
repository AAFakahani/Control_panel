Control_panel
This repository is used to control the robot arm movement by selecting the side to travel using a basic interface that comprises 5 buttons (forward, left, backward, right, and stop), each of which sends a value to the database and prints it on a separate page. I collaborated with Fantastic Group's Fantstic Rahaf.
